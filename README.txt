The zip file Contains 4 files:

1. Scanned copy of all the paperwork that went into the solution. The paperwork basically, explains the problem formulation, the initial state, the goal state,
 any arbitrary state and then it goes on to explain, how to solve this using BFS/DFS and it shows a sample tree and a sample example with actual datastructures.

2. dfs_implementation_example.py --> This serves 2 purposes. First it is a simple implementation of how to do this using DFS(since rest are in BFS only), second it also prints
hich graph has what solution(a message for no solution)

3. paths_graph1.py --> BFS implementation on first graph using Iterative BFS

4. paths_graph2.py --> BFS implementation on second graph using Recursive BFS

Since I was trying out all different implementations, I thought it was better if I demonstrated a sample of all the various ways we can do this hence I have written separate 
code to do almost same things.

Comments for individual files are in the files.
